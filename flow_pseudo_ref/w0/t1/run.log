 ingeo: takes atomic coordinates from input array xred

--- !COMMENT
src_file: m_ingeo.F90
src_line: 900
message: |
    The tolerance on symmetries =   1.000E-05 is bigger than 1.0e-8.
    In order to avoid spurious effects, the atomic coordinates have been
    symmetrized before storing them in the dataset internal variable.
    So, do not be surprised by the fact that your input variables (xcart, xred, ...)
    do not correspond exactly to the ones echoed by ABINIT, the latter being used to do the calculations.
    This is not a problem per se.
    Still, in order to avoid this symmetrization (e.g. for specific debugging/development), decrease tolsym to 1.0e-8 or lower,
    or (much preferred) use input primitive vectors that are accurate to better than 1.0e-8.
    This message will only be printed once, even if there are other datasets where tolsym is bigger than 1.0e-8.

 corresponding to implementations inside of ABINIT that you have used in the present run.
 Note also that it will be of great value to readers of publications presenting these results,
 to read papers enabling them to understand the theoretical formalism and details
 of the ABINIT implementation.
